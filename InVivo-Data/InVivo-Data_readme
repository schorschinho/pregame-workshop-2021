## In Vivo Datasets

Dataset 1: acquired in the human brain (parietal WM, VOI 30x15x20) with a DW-STEAM sequence (TE=45ms, TM=60ms) at 7Tesla (Philips scanner)

The DW-STEAM sequence is set as follows: the diffusion gradients had a duration of 15ms and duration between the start of the first and second diffusion gradients 
(diffusion time) was 79ms. See provided schematic for sequence details.

Metabolites dataset was acquired with:
-- 4 diffusion gradient amplitudes (G=0, 15, 25 and 35mT) and along 3 orthogonal directions ([1,1,-0.5],[-0.5,1,1],[1,-0.5,1])
-- a total of 24 averages per condition (for each b-value and direction)
-- outer-volume suppression
-- VAPOR scheme (with squeezed delays) for water suppression
-- PPU for cardiac triggering
-- other acquisition parameters npoints = 1024, spectral width=3000 Hz

Water dataset was acquired with:
-- exactly same parameters but without water suppresion and with a lower number of averages 
-- a total of 4 averages per condition

We provide:
-- A file with data for metabolites after coil-combination, e.g. a total of 24x(1+3x3)=240 spectra, each with 1024 points
-- A file with data for water after coil-combination, e.g. a total of 4x(1+3x3)=40 spectra, each with 1024 points
-- A file with all b-values (which account for the cross terms with imaging gradients)
-- A file with sequence chronograms (for each gradient amplitude and direction)
-- A basis-set for analysis of the spectra with LCModel or other preferred software
-- A control file for analysis with LCModel (this gives help to get started, but feel free to adapt to your preferred parameters)

Dataset 2: acquired in the human brain (posterior cingulate cortex, VOI 20x20x20) with a DW-sLASER sequence (TE=125ms) at 7Tesla (Philips scanner) 

The DW-sLASER sequence is set as follows: the diffusion gradients had a duration of 8ms and duration between the start of the first and second diffusion blocks (diffusion time) 
was 60ms. See provided schematic for sequence details.

Metabolites dataset was acquired with:
-- 3 diffusion gradient amplitudes (G=10, 18 and 26mT) and along 3 orthogonal directions ([1,1,-0.5],[-0.5,1,1],[1,-0.5,1])
-- a total of 24 averages per condition (for each b-value and direction)
-- VAPOR scheme (with squeezed delays) for water suppression
-- PPU for cardiac triggering
-- other acquisition parameters npoints = 1024, spectral width=3000 Hz

Water dataset was acquired with:
-- exactly same parameters but without water suppresion and with a lower number of averages
-- a total of 4 averages per condition

We provide:
-- A file with data for metabolites after coil-combination, e.g. a total of 24x3x3=216 spectra, each with 1024 points
-- A file with data for water after coil-combination, e.g. a total of 4x3x3=36 spectra, each with 1024 points
-- A file with all b-values (which account for the cross terms with imaging gradients)
-- A file with sequence chronograms (for each gradient amplitude and direction)
-- A basis-set for analysis of the spectra with LCModel or other preferred software
-- A control file for analysis with LCModel (this gives help to get started, but feel free to adapt to your preferred parameters)
